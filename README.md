# üí¨ Dialog
This is a Dialog script where you can talk to specific peds you spawn in config or in other scripts. <br>

## ‚ùìInstallation
Pretty simple install given the ui is already built for you. Just drag the root folder into your servers resources folder and make sure to ensure the folder inside of your server.cfg.

## ‚ùó Dependencies
This resouce is very light on depenedacies. If you do not plan to use this script to spawn peds and would rather spawn them via you own script there are 0 dependencies. Otherwise you will need [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target) or [qb-target](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target)
